# Anama-Ita

~~~About this Project
>This small software/project was developed by Saulo Ferro Maciel.

Its purpose is to help my parents, so I created it very simple and without a definitive interface (it uses the system settings to display the graphical interface)... I still haven't implemented a module to export the database that it generates to a cloud, so in a future update I intend to implement this compatibility.
